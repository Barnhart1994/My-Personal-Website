# This website was made to be in introduction for our class.
# I began by just creating the intro page. I wanted to make sure I had the Nav bar taken care of since the clicking is the most important functional piece.
# Next I entered the images I wanted to use next to the text. I did encounter difficulty getting the images to load on the about and portfolio pages.
# I entered real information on page 1 and 2, but I have no online work to show just yet for the portfolio. That will change soon. 
# I made sure to commit multiple times I was confident that the code was displaying properly from each individual file. 
# Lastly, I went through Github to verify all of the code had been updated correctly.
